Vision Statement

The Apartment Management Application is an Android based application with the goal of streamlining communication within the apartment environment. The purpose of the application is to connect apartment management with tenants, either individually or as a group. Communication between management and tenets is essential to maintaining a strong and efficient apartment ecosystem. The current methods of communication found within the target demographic, which include text messages, paper mail, and sliding paper under doors, are inefficient and unreliable. Our application seeks to improve these methods of communication by centralizing all messages sent between the involved parties in a manner that emphasizes reliability, clarity, and efficiency. With the use of our application, communication failures will decrease, and ease of communication will increase, benefiting all involved stakeholders.
